    <div class="About">
        <p>The best in underground bass music came together to defy rules and disrupt the scene in the second volume of
            LoFreq Records’ Cypher.
            If you haven’t heard of LoFreq Records by now, prepare to be impressed.
            <br>
            Since their launch, the brand has grown both with the shows they put on and the records that have graced
            their thriving imprint. Centered around exceptional bass music that’s dynamic at its core, the label
            continues to impress with each passing release, and now after a successful debut of their Cypher compilation
            series, the second volume has arrived in its entirety so they can blossom even more.
            <br>
            Cypher, Vol. 2 features a whopping 19 tracks from a wide array of artists who created unique
            bass beats that are dark, heavy, and super trippy.
            <br>
            The saga began in September of 2020 with Ahee’s “Underground”, which made critics wish they were at
            a festival whipping their hair. The flow of the vocals left quite the impression as Ahee took it to
            the next level with a stunning bassline. It was the perfect way to kick off the journey.
            <br>
            Fresh bangers quickly followed “Underground” such as Ravenscoon and Yewz‘s “Pegasus”, Xotix and
            DropTalk’s “Mind Control”, and Dark Velvet’s “CHE”.
            <br>
            Ahee also returned for a feature with Dissolv in “Time Technician”, for good measure. The sounds in
            these tunes have rolled in range from subtle kicks to heavy, deep bass sounds.
            <br>
            Now, after months of anticipation for the full release, it’s available for your listening pleasure.
